**You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.**

**You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.**

**Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.**

#

**Example 1:**

    Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 5

_Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5._
_Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell._
**Example 2:**

    Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0

**Pseudocode:**

```
solution function(int[] prices)
    declare minPrice = MAX
    declare maxProfit = 0

    for 0 to prices.length
        minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i])
        maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minPrice)

    return maxProfit
```
