**You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.**

**You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.**

**Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.**

#

**Example 1:**

    Input: cost = [10,15,20]
    Output: 15

_Explanation: You will start at index 1._

_- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top._

_The total cost is 15._

**Example 2:**

    Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
    Output: 6

_Explanation: You will start at index 0._

_- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2._

_- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4._

_- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6._

_- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7._

_- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9._

_- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top._

_The total cost is 6._

**Pseudocode:**

```
solution function(int[] cost)
    cost[len] = min(cost[len], cost[len] + cost[len + 1])

    for i from len - 3 to 0
        cost[i] = min(cost[i] + cost[i + 1], cost[i] + cost[i + 2])

    return min(cost[0], cost[1])
```
